# Lesson 2: Bayes
Example of Arcerous vs. Non-Arcerous using a horse as a target and providing numerous examples of what is arcerous and what is non-arcerous.
* Need to identify **features** of the object to be classfied, such as colour, size, number of legs etc. Machine learning can classify objects into classes by using examples that it can learn from.
* This is called **supervised classification**. The system learns from **tagged** examples.

## Features & Labels
* We input **features** and try to input **labels**.
* We determine features of music, and then we take a person's interest as Like or Dislike.
* Use a **scatterplot**

## Stanley Terrain Classificiation
* Features: steepness (grade) and bumpiness
* Using scatter plots
** Make predictions of new points when viewing a dataset
* Decision Surfaces
